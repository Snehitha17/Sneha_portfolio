# [Project 1: Amazon-Apparel-Recommendation](https://github.com/Snehitha17/Amazon-Apparel-Recommendation)

Build a recommendation engine which suggests similar products (apparel) to the given product (apparel) in any e-commerce websites based on the implict data i.e when they type the title, brand, type etc produce recommendations.

# [Project 3: Human Activity recognition](https://github.com/Snehitha17/human-activity-recognition)

To build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.

# [Project 4: New-York-taxi-prediction](https://github.com/Snehitha17/New-York-taxi-prediction)

Predict the pick up density of yellow cabs at a given particular time and a location in new york city using Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Time Series Forecasting and Fourier Transformation.

# [Project 5: Cancer Patient Diagnosis](https://github.com/Snehitha17/Cancer-Diagnosis)

Classify the given genetic variations/mutations based on evidence from text- based clinical literature using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, TF-IDF and Feature Engineering.

# [Project 6: Quora-Question-Pair-Similarity](https://github.com/Snehitha17/Quora-question-pair-similarity)

Identify which questions asked on Quora are duplicates of questions that have already been asked. This could be useful to instantly provide answers to questions that have already been answered.
